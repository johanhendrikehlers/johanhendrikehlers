My name is Johan Ehlers, I am a software engineer based in Cape Town, South Africa. I am also an entrepreneur and I have taken my own SaaS application to market. I have a record of building Spring Framework solutions that stretch back to 2012. I have worked on Fintech, e-commerce, logistics, and CRM solutions, to name a few. From a front-end perspective, I have worked with a wide range of technologies, but I have a solid background in building Angular-based solutions and taking them to market.
