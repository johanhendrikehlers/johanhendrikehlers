If you look at the project reactor docs, it states one of the reasons why you would use the library is because [Blocking can be wasteful](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#_blocking_can_be_wasteful), in this little research project we test 2 implementations of a simple service, one blocking and the other non blocking and see where one is better than the other.

<!--more-->

Here is the interface for the service. The service will generate sequential numbers for users queuing to get help at a support desk. I.E. the first user will be no. 1 in the queue, then no. 2, etc.:

```Java
public interface QueueNumberService {

 public int getNumber();

}
```

The blocking implementation looks like this:

```Java
public class QueueNumberServiceBlocking implements QueueNumberService {

 private int count = 0;

 private Object lock = new Object();

 @Override
 public int getNumber() {
  synchronized (lock) {
   return ++count;
  }
 }
}
```

And the non blocking implementation looks like this:

```Java
public class QueueNumberServiceNonBlocking implements QueueNumberService {

 private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

 @Override
 public int getNumber() {
  return count.incrementAndGet();
 }
}
```

You will see in the test directory a unit test that made sure all users did get a queue number, and tested several scenarios, mostly using different batch sizes. On my 8 core machine I got the following results for a queue of 100 million users:

| Batch Size | Blocking (ms) | Non Blocking (ms) |
| ---------: | ------------: | ----------------: |
|          1 |        ★ 4672 |              5018 |
|         10 |          5091 |            ★ 1538 |
|        100 |          4381 |            ★ 1913 |
|       1000 |          4283 |            ★ 1869 |
|      10000 |          4038 |            ★ 1857 |
|     100000 |          5050 |            ★ 1878 |

In conclusion, non blocking rocks!
